## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yasinmusani/oracle-ai-vector-search.git
cd oracle-ai-vector-search
```

### 2. Create and Activate Python Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download or Provide Hugging Face Model

Place the Hugging Face model (e.g. `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) locally under:

```
models/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/
```

You can download it using:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer
AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
AutoModel.from_pretrained("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
```

Then move the `.cache` content into `models/`.

### 5. Configure Oracle DB Credentials

Update your `.env` file or hardcode in `db_utils.py`:

```
DB_USER=hr
DB_PASSWORD=oracle
DB_DSN=localhost/freepdb1
```

---

### 6. Populate Vector Embeddings

```bash
python app/vectorize_update.py
```

---

### 7. Run Flask API

```bash
python app/main.py
```

- Endpoint: `http://localhost:5000/search`
- Sample Request:

```json
{
  "query": "smartphone"
}
```

---

### 8. Run Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app/ui.py
```

- Visit: `http://localhost:8501`

---

## üß™ Sample Data

Refer to [`sample_products.csv`](sample_products.csv) for sample products. Insert them into your Oracle DB using a bulk `INSERT` statement and generate embeddings for the `VECTOR` column.

---

## üì¨ Example Output

**Request**:

```json
{ "query": "Watch" }
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "results": [
    ["Smartwatch", "Fitness tracking with heart rate monitor", 0.8155],
    ["Smartphone", "Latest model with AI camera features", 0.8299],
    ["eBook Reader", "6-inch glare-free display", 0.8787],
    ["Gaming Keyboard", "Mechanical keyboard with RGB lighting", 0.9783],
    ["Noise Cancelling Headphones", "Over-ear headphones with ANC", 0.9808]
  ]
}
```
