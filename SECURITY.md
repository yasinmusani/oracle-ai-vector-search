# 🔐 Security Policy

Welcome! We're glad you're using or contributing to the Oracle AI Vector Search Starter project. Security is a shared responsibility, and we’re committed to protecting users and contributors.

## 🚨 Found a Security Issue?

Please report any security concerns **privately** via email:

📩 `musaniyasin@gmail.com`

Be sure to include:
- A clear summary of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if known)
- Any logs, stack traces, or screenshots
- Your system (OS, Oracle DB version, Python version)

We’ll aim to respond within **5 days**, and we’ll work with you to verify, fix, and responsibly disclose the issue.

## ✅ Guidelines for Contributors

Help keep this project secure by following these practices:
- Never commit `.p12` or wallet files
- Use `.env` files or secret managers for credentials
- Avoid exposing database credentials or endpoints in logs or UI
- Keep dependencies (Oracle client, Python libs) up to date

## 🙌 Responsible Disclosure

We support and appreciate responsible security research. If you're not sure whether something is a bug or a security risk, feel free to ask — it's better to report than to ignore.
